<h1>About</h1>
<p>This is a mini-project meant to teach myself how to write test cases using Mocha w/ JavaScript. The immediate goal is to write out multiple functions with comprehensive test cases, not to establish a curriculum at the moment. However, teaching is a not too long term goal of mine, and learning to write my own test cases is critical.</p>

<p>I've previously written tests using Jest extension in VS Code, but I believe limiting myself to that test case framework is very restrictive when I think fowardly and having to restrict others to my setup to learn from me. I believe mocha to be a more diverse and overall more flexible option and wish to push myself to learn it.</p>
